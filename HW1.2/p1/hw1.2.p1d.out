How I debug using gdb:

1. compile with -g flag for debugging

	g++ -g -o hw1.2.p1.bug hw1.2.p1.bug.cpp hw1.2.p1a.cpp

2. start gdb

	gdb -q hw1.2.p1.bug

3. type 'l' to show the syntax

4. type 'b n" (n is some line number) to set breakpoints. I set two breakpoints at line 18 and 21, just before and after p1 and p2 assign values.

5. type 'r' to execute the program. It stops at breakpoint 1 (line 18). Type 'c' to continue, and then it crahses, so the problem is probably because of the assign function.


What is the bug:

Function malloc() just allocates the memory for the object but does not call constructor, so the instance variables' memory is still undefined. 
However, function assign() in hw1.2.p1a.cpp involves initiating instance variable _str, and that's the reason why the program crashes with segmentation fault.
